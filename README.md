<h3 style="background: #8F3985; color:#EFD9CE">Dashboard</h3>
- As it is trial project it doesn't implemented any tests even I don't like developing like that I follow some tutorial. No way to validate everything will work after some changes. Don't do like that follow TDD please :)
- Authentication is missing. So everybody can access your dashboard if you publish it.
- API is missing :( I would probably write some API with FastAPI and bring data from there.
- But it looks great :)
- I might add later on missing parts and improve theme of dashboard. (There are many css stuff I adore I might implement here)
- There is a possibility I might containerize it.
- Ofc it depends on my availability.
